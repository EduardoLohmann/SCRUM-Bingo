    <br>
    <p>
        This little project is all about bringing some spice into your daily meetings.<br>
        We all know that each person tends to repeat him/herself quite a lot, and that <br>
        get somewhat tiring when you have your own tasks and issues to work on. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        So, since you probably can't just leave the meeting, it'd be nice to have some <br>
        way to at least make this time a little more casual. This is where the bingo comes in!
    </p>

    

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Insert records with people's names</li>
        <li>For each person, add words they are used to use a lot when they speak</li>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete and modify records you alredy recorded</li>
            <li>Words can reference a specific person, or everyone (use it for really generic terms like 'Meeting' or 'Code') </li>
            <li>Some generic words are already built-in to ease your life, but feel free to modify however you like</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Generate a bingo card</li>
        <li>During the meeting, mark up any words said by them with the mouse</li>
        <li>Thats it! See if you can score a bingo and share a screenshot with your friends!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Now, a word of advice. Use this at your own discretion. If you have trouble concentrating in meetings <br>
        or you're new at your job, maybe its not the best idea to seek distractions like this.
